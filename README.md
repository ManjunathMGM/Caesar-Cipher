# 🌐 Caesar Cipher in Python

Encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm!

</div>

## 📚 Description

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. Julius Caesar used this technique to send secret messages to his allies.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
3. Enter the message and the shift value.
4. Get the result!

## 🌈 Example

Here is the result of encoding and decoding a Caesar Cipher-encrypted message:

```
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
Hello
Type the shift number:
5
Here's the encoded result: mjqqt
```

Here is the result of decoding a Caesar Cipher-encrypted message:

```
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
decode
Type your message:
mjqqt
Type the shift number:
5
Here's the decoded result: hello
```
